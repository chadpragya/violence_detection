# Violence Detection System

An advanced computer vision application that leverages artificial intelligence to automatically identify and classify violent activities in video content. Built upon a fine-tuned YOLOv8 deep learning model, this system provides real-time detection capabilities with high accuracy and precision.

## Features

- **Real-time Violence Detection**: Process live video streams with 15-30 FPS performance
- **Batch Video Analysis**: Upload and analyze pre-recorded videos (MP4, AVI, MOV)
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit-based dashboard
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for CUDA-enabled devices with CPU fallback
- **Visual Annotations**: Bounding box visualizations with confidence scores
- **Export Capabilities**: Download annotated videos with detection results

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Machine Learning Backend**: Fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for object detection and classification
2. **Web Application Frontend**: Streamlit-based user interface
3. **Video Processing Pipeline**: Frame-by-frame analysis and annotation system

### Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CUDA (GPU support)
